That's just a small program for extracting specific data from big files.

The problem: My fiance was receiving big PDF files every month. They were phone bills for a company and there are a lot of accounts and their monthly bills. Her Job was to go/scroll through all of the accounts and manually write down their bills.

The solution: Program for going through the file and searching for keywords such as name, bill, date issued, etc. Collect all that's needed and transform it into nicely sorted information. For the interface of the program, I've used Tkinter.

About Bills Extractor 1.0: It was doing the same thing but written on 30 lines of code in just one .py file. (Amateur work) I've rewrote the program using the OOP principles such as (abstraction, and inheritance) and I also used the Open-closed principle so if everyone ever needed it it could easily transform the program for their needs.
